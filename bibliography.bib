    abstract = {The interaction of a uniformly expanding gas with a stationary ambient medium is studied in the case where the expanding matter has a power-law density profile (ρ ∝ r-n), as well as the ambient medium (ρ ∝ r-s). Self-similar solutions for the structure of the interaction region can be found provided that s{\textless}3 and n{\textgreater}5. Models for Type I supernovae indicate that a ρ ∝ r-7 profile may occur in the outer part of the expanding star. The n = 7, s = 0 solution is applied to the remnant of Tycho's supernova, and it is found to reproduce the basic dynamical and morphological properties of the remnant. The model may also explain the lack of strong Fe line emission in the X-ray spectrum. The solutions with s = 2 are applicable to Type II supernovae because the expanding supernova envelopes probably interact with regions of presupernova mass loss. The properties of the interactions region are important for the X-ray emission from Type II supernovae.},

    abstract = {The interaction of the outer parts of a supernova envelope with circumstellar matter creates a high-energy density shell. The equation of motion of the shell is deduced on the basis of the approximations that the shell is thin and that the supernova density profile is a power law in radius. It is noted that the density structure in the shell is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and that the energy density created by the instability can be a substantial fraction of the original thermal energy density. The instability can drive turbulent motions, and these, it is thought, may amplify the magnetic field and accelerate relativistic electrons. If the efficiency of these processes is comparable to that inferred from the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, the observed radio luminosity from SN 1980k and SN 1979 may be reproduced. Several mechanisms for the early low-frequency absorption of the radio emission are considered.},
